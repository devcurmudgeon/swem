This small project aims to provide a visual aid to model how software project
teams work.

Obviously any attempt to model complex human interactions involves
simplification. "All models are wrong". Even so, a model can help us to
understand complex emergent behaviours.

This model could ultimately aim to take into account some or all of the
following factors:

[x] Scope/scale of project in effort days
[x] Team size
[x] Release cadence
[ ] Task planning size
[ ] Task actual size
[ ] Developer cycle time
[ ] Integration cycle time
[ ] Team motivation
[ ] Delivery pressure
[ ] Team aptitude
[ ] Reviews
[ ] Lag time to unblock
[ ] Dependency control
[ ] Lines of code
[ ] existing code reuse (including foss or 3rd party)
