# SWEM (software engineering model)

This small project aims to provide a visual aid for modeling how software
project teams work. It's a work-in-progress.

Obviously any attempt to model complex human interactions involves
simplification. "All models are wrong". Even so, a model can help us to
understand complex emergent behaviours.

This model could ultimately aim to take into account some or all of the
following factors:

- [x] Scope of project in engineer days
- [x] Team size
- [x] Release cadence
- [ ] Task planning size
- [x] Task actual size
- [ ] Developer cycle time
- [ ] Integration cycle time
- [x] Team motivation
- [ ] Delivery pressure
- [x] Team aptitude
- [x] Reviews
- [x] Lag time to unblock
- [ ] Dependency control
- [ ] Lines of code
- [ ] Existing code reuse (including foss or 3rd party)

# Getting Started

rinse and repeat. Expect lots of bugs.

# Contributing
